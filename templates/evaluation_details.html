<h4><strong><code>Metrics for evaluation</code></strong></h4>

<p>We use log-average miss rate and recall for evaluation, which is a popular metric in the Pedestrian Detection task.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Log-Average Miss Rate(LAMR)<br />
	:&nbsp;Miss rate is a percentage of pedestrians missed(False Negative) among all ground truth pedestrians [FN / (TP+FN) = 1 - recall rate]. LAMR is computed by averaging miss rate at nine FPPI rates evenly spaced in log-space in the range 1e&minus;2 to 1e-0</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 3&nbsp;evaluation metrics, three LAMRs for the day, night, and all(day+night).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><code>Train Annotations</code></strong></h4>

<p>There are three versions of annotations for KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Dataset.</p>

<ul>
	<li>First, the <strong><u>original annotations</u></strong> were provided by Hwang et al. [1].</li>
	<li>Second, the <strong><u>sanitized annotations</u></strong> were provided by Li et al. [2].</li>
	<li>Lastly, the <strong><u>paired annotations</u></strong> were provided by Zhang et al. [3].</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><code>Test Annotations</code></strong></h4>

<p>The sanitized annotations [2] are used in this challenge for evaluation. The sanitized annotations eliminate the annotation errors, including imprecise localization, misclassification and misaligned regions. The annotations are mostly used in recent works for evaluation, and therefore we also adopt the annotations to conduct a fair comparison.</p>
